All Credit goes to SirMashedPotato for making the original mod. I merely updated it to be compatible with Mashed's Ashlands






ITEM REFERENCES
ebony & glass references updated
netch jelly and leather reference updated
kwama egg helmet now requires fetcher fly hive core (stc)
updated recipes for workbenches (kresh fiber conversion, chemfuel from shalk chitin)
slightly updated kwama egg helmet description to reflect the ingredient change

DEPENDENCIES
updated about.xml to reflect new mod dependencies
removed requirement to load dunmer beforehand to avoid infinite loop

TESTING:
everything but her armor confirmed craftable
ashlander workbench material conversion confirmed
in minimum viable modlist, dunmer factions confirmed to sell techprints
no red or yellow errors when crafting
items not tested in a normal length playthought, but since only recipes were changed, it shouldn't be a factor
